# Experiment log

This log starts with no new policy-learning experiments. Earlier experiments remain in the [archive](artifact_layout.md#archive); they are not carried forward as fresh results or restored checkpoints.

## Frozen starting-point provenance

The cleanup starts from repository commit `176eb0a2b190f5c6ccae54d076385b0075e795a1` (`adding walker2d stats`). The active checkout retains standard CPU MPPI, environment runners, CPU tuning, and simulator tests. Use the actual checked-out commit as the baseline for each new experiment.

Walker controller/task behavior and their JSON files are retained. The frozen inputs have these SHA-256 fingerprints:

| Input | SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| `configs/walker2d_best.json` | `16435775c846c8037cc17be218cdf1255fa9abb971174ff04f4df363449a3ad6` |
| `configs/walker2d_task.json` | `546f6902405daaddb37fb9c458d77fb5159234d1218ec73abf9a625ec9f8f27a` |
| `assets/walker2d.xml` | `4f33bf5069a0bf65056871ab4579f09c62696e7f46c3af6936efedacc572d590` |

The historical Walker qualification completed **19/20** nominal eight-second episodes, with mean speed **1.461 m/s** and episode-averaged speed MAE **0.148 m/s**. It used resets 30–39 paired with planner seeds 10030–10039 and 20030–20039, 1000 controls per episode, and the protocol recorded as chosen on 2026-09-05. The original [protocol](/Users/jaisel/Documents/workbench/mppi-gps-archive-20261004/runs/walker2d_teacher/initial2_protocol.md) and [raw-trace-checked summary](/Users/jaisel/Documents/workbench/mppi-gps-archive-20261004/runs/walker2d_teacher/initial2_qualification_summary.json) are the authoritative provenance record, including original source/config hashes, package versions, and artifact hashes.

That result belongs to the recorded historical source. Cleanup edits can change source hashes even when controller behavior is preserved. Fresh interface tests and short seeded smoke/parity checks do not constitute another twenty-episode qualification. No qualified controller-performance claim is made for the other retained environments. Detailed historical interpretation is in [Walker teacher notes](walker_teacher.md).

## New experiment protocol

1. Create a branch for one question. Record its name and the exact baseline commit before changing code or configs.
2. Allocate a unique ignored directory such as `runs/<date>_<question>_<run-id>/`. Keep configs, reports, traces, diagnostics, and checkpoints together.
3. Write the question, comparison/baseline, environment and task objective, config paths and hashes, source fingerprints, dependency versions, and reset/planner seeds before running. Separate development from untouched qualification seeds.
4. Fix the acceptance criteria and primary metrics before inspecting results. Change one factor at a time when the comparison requires attribution.
5. Record complete, failed, interrupted, and rejected runs. Preserve every report and raw trace used to support a decision. State whether a check concerns simulator correctness, interface compatibility, teacher control quality, or standalone policy performance.
6. Update status, results, interpretation, and the keep/reject/revise decision. Link artifact paths and code/config revisions. A partial run or a proposed method is not a validated result.
7. Graduate validated changes to `main` through normal commits after the recorded criteria and relevant regression checks pass. Preserve unsuccessful experiment branches and their records.
